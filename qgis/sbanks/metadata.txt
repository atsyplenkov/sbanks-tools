description=Smooth vector geometries using Savitzky-Golay or Whittaker-Eilers filters with optional spline resampling
version=0.1
author=Anatoly Tsyplenkov
email=hard.sign9115@fastmail.com

about=The plugin performs vector geometry smoothing using Savitzky-Golay (1964) or Whittaker-Eilers (2003) filters with optional spline resampling. The Whittaker-Eilers filter supports distance-aware smoothing for unevenly spaced data. Uses sbanks-core library for pure Python smoothing algorithms without additional dependencies, making it easy to install plugin in managed environments.

Dependencies: This plugin requires numpy and scipy packages, which are commonly available in standard QGIS Python 3+ environments. If your QGIS installation does not have these packages, you may need to install them manually:
  - On Linux/macOS: `pip install numpy scipy` or use your system package manager
  - On Windows with OSGeo4W: Packages should be included by default in QGIS Python environment.
